/* The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[] of size n. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day, Find the maximum profit which you can get.

Note: You can only hold one stock at a time.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
a = {3, 4, 1, 5}
Output:
5
Explanation:
We can buy stock on day 1 (at price 3) and sell it on 
day 2 (at price 4) profit will be 4-3=1, 
We can buy another stock on day 3 (at price 1) and sell 
it on day 4 (at price 5) profit will be 5-1=4, 
which will give us maximum profit of 5. */
